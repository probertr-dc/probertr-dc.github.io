  <h1> Half-past Two </h1>
  <p class="poem">Once upon a schooltime <br>
    He did Something Very Wrong <br>
    (I forget what it was).<br>
    <br>
    And She said he’d done<br>
    Something Very Wrong, and must<br>
    Stay in the school-room till half-past two.<br>
    <br>
    (Being cross, she’d forgotten<br>
    She hadn’t taught him Time.<br>
    He was too scared of being wicked to remind her.)<br>
    <br>
    He knew a lot of time: he knew<br>
    Gettinguptime, timeyouwereofftime,<br>
    Timetogohomenowtime, Tvtime,<br>
    <br>
    Timeformykisstime (that was Grantime).<br>
    All the important times he knew,<br>
    But not half-past two.<br>
    <br>
    He knew the clockface, the little eyes<br>
    And two long legs for walking,<br>
    But he couldn’t click its language,<br>
    <br>
    So he waited, beyond onceupona,<br>
    Out of reach of all the timefors,<br>
    And knew he’d escaped for ever<br>
    <br>
    Into the smell of old chrysanthemums on Her desk,<br>
    Into the silent noise his hangnail made.<br>
    Into the air outside the window, into ever.<br>
    <br>
    And then, <em>My goodness</em>, she said,<br>
    Scuttling in, <em>I forgot all about you.<br>
    Run along or you’ll be late.</em><br>
    <br>
    So she slotted him back into schooltime,<br>
    And he got home in time for teatime,<br>
    Nexttime, notimeforthatnowtime,<br>
    <br>
    But he never forgot how once by not knowing time,<br>
    He escaped into the clockless land of ever,<br>
    Where time hides tick-less waiting to be born.
