        <p class="poem">
            Once upon a schooltime <br>
            He did Something Very Wrong <br>
            (I forget what it was).<br>
            <br>
            And She said he’d done<br>
            Something Very Wrong, and must<br>
            Stay in the school-room till half-past two.<br>
            <br>
            (Being cross, she’d forgotten<br>
            She hadn’t taught him Time.<br>
            He was too scared of being wicked to remind her.)<br>
            <br>
            He knew a lot of time: he knew<br>
            Gettinguptime, timeyouwereofftime,<br>
            Timetogohomenowtime, Tvtime,<br>
            <br>
            Timeformykisstime (that was Grantime).<br>
            All the important times he knew,<br>
            But not half-past two.<br>
            <br>
            He knew the clockface, the little eyes<br>
            And two long legs for walking,<br>
            But he couldn’t click its language,<br>
            <br>
            So he waited, beyond onceupona,<br>
            Out of reach of all the timefors,<br>
            And knew he’d escaped for ever<br>
            <br>
            Into the smell of old chrysanthemums on Her desk,<br>
            Into the silent noise his hangnail made.<br>
            Into the air outside the window, into ever.<br>
            <br>
            And then, <em>My goodness</em>, she said,<br>
            Scuttling in, <em>
                I forgot all about you.<br>
                Run along or you’ll be late.
            </em><br>
            <br>
            So she slotted him back into schooltime,<br>
            And he got home in time for teatime,<br>
            Nexttime, notimeforthatnowtime,<br>
            <br>
            But he never forgot how once by not knowing time,<br>
            He escaped into the clockless land of ever,<br>
            Where time hides tick-less waiting to be born.
